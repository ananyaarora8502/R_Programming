This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

Confusion matrix:
  
   True Positive : those instances where predicted class is equal to actual class 
  True Negative :  those instances where predicted class is not equal to actual class
  False positive: those instances where predicted class is positive but actually the instances are                         negative 
  False negative: those instances where predicted class is negative but actually the instances are     positive.
  
  Precision=TP/(TP+FP);
  >>identifies the frequency with which a model was correct when predicting the positive class
  Recall=TP/(TP+FN);
  >>identifies out that out of all the possible labels how many did the model correctly identified.
   Answers the question --what percentage of the actual bird did we find?
